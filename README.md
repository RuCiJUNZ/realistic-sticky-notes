## Feature Highlights

### Realistic Sticky Notes

- **Zero Syntax:** Double-click to create or edit notes instantly. You can also copy and paste notes directly.

- **Deep Customization:** Fully customize the **Style**, **Size**, **Pin Type** (Tape, Pin, Clip, or Circle), **Background** (Solid, Lined, Grid, or Custom Images), **Color**, and **Shape**.

- **Full Markdown Support:** Seamlessly use Obsidian's native Markdown syntax inside notes, including support for pasted images and GIFs.

- **Cross-Platform:** Optimized for a smooth experience on both iOS and Android mobile devices.


### Board Management

- **Smart Views:** Toggle between **Overview Mode** and **Center View**. Easily switch between **Aligned** or **Random Rotation** for that authentic "messy" whiteboard look.

- **Multiple Boards:** Pre-set with 6 board backgrounds. Create, manage, or delete multiple independent boards and adjust the canvas height to fit your needs.

- **Focus Mode:** Toggle a "Narrow Width" option from the toolbar to maximize your workspace (affects the current board file only).


### Transparent Data Storage

- **Secure & Open:** Every sticky note's data is stored as an **independent .md file** within your vault, ensuring your data remains human-readable and future-proof.
